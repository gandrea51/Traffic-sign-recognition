# ðŸ›‘ Traffic Sign Recognition - GTSRB Project

Project work by **Deep Learning** for the recognition of road signs using **GTSRB**.  
Three different **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** based on architectures inspired by **LeNet5** were implemented and analyzed.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project objectives

The objective is to train and evaluate CNNs that manage to classify the **43 types of road signs** present in the **GTSRB** dataset, by means of

- Data preprocessing and **data augmentation**;
- **several CNN** development;
- Testing on **external images** to the dataset;
- Error and **generalization ability analysis**.
